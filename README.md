# Language choice
I chose Kotlin over Java because:
* It compiles to Java bytecode.
* It is less verbose than Java.
* It is more natural both to read and write, which makes
writing code easier and faster while still allowing Java developers
who have never seen it to understand it.
Not to say it does not have its fallbacks, like the questionable lack
of a package-private access modifier or static analysis tools (aside
from the IntelliJ IDEA inspector, which is hard to set up in CI
servers). But I don't see any of these issues as blockers for a small
and fast project.
# Documentation
Documentation is generated using [Dokka](https://github.com/Kotlin/dokka), which is the
code documentation generation tool for Kotlin, similar to what Javadoc is for Java.
`index.html` for the documentation of each module can be found in their `build` directories:
 `module_name/build/dokka/module_name/index.html`.
# Tests
 Unit and integration tests are written using [Spek](htts://spekframework.org), the specification
 framework for Kotlin. Run them with the `test` Gradle task in each module.
 Instrumentation tests are only present in the `app` module and can be run using the `cAT` task.
