/**
 * Exposes entry points to data obtained by and handled in this module. If we were to have more
 * requests, it would probably be a good idea to have more facades, not necessarily on a 1:1
 * facade-request proportion, but just so we don't end up exposing too many requests in the same
 * facade.
 * Having a Facade might seem like "too much decoupling" (if such a thing exists) since we
 * already have a dedicated data module, but it eases separating unit from integration tests,
 * since the request sources, like TopRequestSource, just default to already unit-tested third-party
 * delegates, and therefore only really need to have integration tests.
